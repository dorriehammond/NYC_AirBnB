## Project Description

After a long investigation of the dataset, we stepped away with one major takeaway: proximity and accesibility to NYC attractions seems to affect listings’ prices a lot. Thus, we wanted to explore this a bit more in depth with our project. We came into this project wondering why the price of each listing can change so dramatically from neighbourhood to neighbourhood, so we wanted our project to be location focused. Our goal with this project is to show that attractions can have a big impact on the price of AirBnB listings. We chose to focus in on NYC’s arguably most notable and visited attraction: Times Square. Within our project we want to investigate the impact Times Square has on listings’ prices. Since the price will also be different according to room type (as found through our investigating), we chose to focus on one room type for consistency: Entire home/apartment.

## Improved Map

The following map shows the relationship between New York City's average neighborhood AirBnB price and distance to Times Square.
